# Phase 4 Implementation Test Guide

## Quick Verification Tests

### Test 1: Check UI Loads Without Errors
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Settings → Data Sync
2. Verify page loads without errors
3. Check that all 8 sync processes are displayed
4. Verify sync overview shows correct counts

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ All process cards visible
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Status badges show correct values

### Test 2: Authentication Warning Display
**Steps:**
1. Log out if logged in
2. Navigate to Settings → Data Sync
3. Check for authentication warning

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Red warning alert shows "ESI Authentication Required"
- ✅ Explains need for EVE SSO login
- ✅ "Run Now" buttons should still be visible but will fail gracefully

### Test 3: Manual Login User Warning
**Steps:**
1. Log in with manual credentials (admin/12345)
2. Navigate to Settings → Data Sync
3. Check for authentication guidance

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Info alert shows manual login detected
- ✅ Explains need for EVE SSO authentication
- ✅ Process cards show but sync will require ESI token

### Test 4: Manual Sync Trigger (Without ESI)
**Steps:**
1. Ensure logged in with manual credentials
2. Enable "Corporation Members" sync
3. Click "Run Now" button
4. Observe behavior

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Toast error: "Corporation authentication required. Please log in with ESI."
- ✅ Sync does not execute
- ✅ No progress bar appears
- ✅ No errors in console

### Test 5: Manual Sync Trigger (With ESI - If Available)
**Steps:**
1. Log in with EVE SSO (if ESI configured)
2. Navigate to Settings → Data Sync
3. Enable "Corporation Members" sync
4. Click "Run Now" button
5. Watch progress

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Progress bar appears
- ✅ Current step updates (Initializing → Fetching → Storing → Completed)
- ✅ Percentage increases from 0% to 100%
- ✅ Toast success message with item count
- ✅ History entry added
- ✅ Last sync time updates

### Test 6: Sync History Display
**Steps:**
1. After running a sync (successful or failed)
2. Scroll to "Recent Sync History" section
3. Verify entry appears

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ New entry at top of history
- ✅ Shows process name and icon
- ✅ Shows timestamp
- ✅ Shows duration
- ✅ Shows success/error icon
- ✅ Shows items processed (if successful)
- ✅ Shows error message (if failed)

### Test 7: Progress Updates
**Steps:**
1. Trigger a sync that takes time (like assets)
2. Watch the progress bar
3. Observe current step text

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Progress bar fills smoothly
- ✅ Step text changes: "Initializing..." → "Fetching..." → "Storing..." → "Completed"
- ✅ Items count shows "X / Y items" during sync
- ✅ Percentage matches progress bar

### Test 8: Error Handling
**Steps:**
1. Trigger sync with expired/invalid token (if possible)
2. OR trigger sync without proper permissions
3. Observe error display

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Progress bar stops
- ✅ Status changes to "error"
- ✅ Red X icon appears
- ✅ Error message displays in card
- ✅ Toast error notification shows
- ✅ History entry shows error with message

### Test 9: Multiple Processes
**Steps:**
1. Enable multiple sync processes
2. Verify all can be configured
3. Try running multiple syncs

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Each process has independent enable toggle
- ✅ Each process has separate interval setting
- ✅ Each can be triggered independently
- ✅ Each shows its own progress
- ✅ Running badge updates correctly

### Test 10: Settings Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Enable a process and set custom interval
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if settings persisted

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Enable state persists
- ✅ Interval value persists
- ✅ Sync history persists
- ✅ Last sync times persist

## Component Integration Checks

### SyncStateManager Integration
**Verify:**
- ✅ `useSyncState()` hook works
- ✅ State updates trigger UI re-renders
- ✅ History array populates
- ✅ Status updates in real-time

### SyncExecutor Integration
**Verify:**
- ✅ Executor instance created successfully
- ✅ Process type mapping works
- ✅ Context object constructed correctly
- ✅ Results returned properly

### Auth Integration
**Verify:**
- ✅ `useAuth()` provides user data
- ✅ Corporation ID available when ESI authenticated
- ✅ Access token available when ESI authenticated
- ✅ Auth method detected correctly

## Console Logging Checks

During sync, you should see console logs like:
```
🚀 Starting sync process: corporation_members
🔄 Starting sync process: members for corporation 123456789
✅ Sync process members completed - 42 items processed
```

OR on error:
```
❌ Sync process members failed: [error message]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Run Now" button does nothing
**Solution:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check if process is already running

### Issue: Progress bar doesn't update
**Solution:**
- Verify SyncStateManager is notifying listeners
- Check if useSyncState() hook is working
- Ensure state updates are being saved

### Issue: History doesn't show entries
**Solution:**
- Check if sync actually ran
- Verify SyncStateManager.completeSync() or .failSync() was called
- Check KV storage for 'sync-history' key

### Issue: Authentication warnings always show
**Solution:**
- Verify user object has corporationId and accessToken
- Check if ESI login completed successfully
- Verify auth state is updating correctly

## Performance Checks

### Expected Performance:
- UI should remain responsive during sync
- Progress updates should appear smoothly
- No UI freezing or blocking
- History should load instantly (max 100 entries)

## Success Criteria Summary

Phase 4 is successfully implemented if:
- ✅ All 10 tests pass
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
- ✅ Real-time progress updates work
- ✅ Sync history populates correctly
- ✅ Authentication validation works
- ✅ Error handling provides useful feedback
- ✅ Settings persist across refreshes
- ✅ UI remains responsive during syncs

## Next Testing Phase

After Phase 4 verification, Phase 5 testing will cover:
- Automatic sync scheduling
- Background sync execution
- Interval-based polling
- Multiple concurrent syncs
- Schedule management
