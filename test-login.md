# Login Test Results

## Direct Navigation Implementation

âœ… **Changes Made:**
1. Added `onSuccess` callback parameter to `login()` function in auth.ts
2. Modified LoginPage to accept `onLoginSuccess` prop
3. Updated handleCredentialLogin to call the success callback
4. App component now provides direct navigation function to LoginPage

## Expected Flow:
1. User enters admin/12345 credentials
2. Login succeeds and calls success callback
3. Success callback directly sets activeTab to 'dashboard'  
4. User should immediately see the dashboard

## Debug Features:
- Console logging at each step
- Debug info display in UI
- Auth state shown in development overlay

## Test Instructions:
1. Enter username: `admin`
2. Enter password: `12345` 
3. Click "Sign In" or press Enter
4. Should immediately navigate to Dashboard tab

The direct navigation approach bypasses React's normal state propagation delays and forces an immediate page change upon successful authentication.
