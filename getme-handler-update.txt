## Summary of GetMe System Updates

The GetMe Package system has been updated to work with a 3-machine architecture:

1. **Windows GUI** - Where user configures the app
2. **Linux Web Host** - Where the React app is hosted
3. **Linux Database Server** - Target machine for database setup

### How It Works Now:

**"Download GetMe Package" Button:**
- Generates a bash script with all credentials pre-configured
- Downloads to Windows machine (or wherever browser is running)
- Shows toast with simple command: `sudo bash getme-lmeve-YYYY-MM-DD.sh`
- Copies command to clipboard
- Script is completely standalone - no parameters needed

**"Transfer Instructions" Button:**
- Downloads comprehensive transfer guide
- Explains 3 methods:
  1. **RECOMMENDED**: Open app directly on database server browser (no transfer needed)
  2. Windows → Database transfer (SCP/WinSCP/FileZilla)
  3. Two-hop transfer (Windows → Web Host → Database)
- Copies recommended command to clipboard
- Shows quick reference in toast notification

### The GetMe Script:
- Tests MySQL connection
- Creates `lmeve` and `EveStaticData` databases
- Creates user with full permissions
- Downloads EVE SDE from Fuzzwork
- Imports SDE data
- Verifies installation
- **All credentials are embedded - just run it!**

### Best Practice Workflow:
1. Configure database settings in Settings tab
2. Click "Transfer Instructions" to understand your options
3. **EASIEST**: SSH to database server, install browser, navigate to app, click "Download GetMe Package"
4. Run: `sudo ./getme-lmeve-*.sh`
5. Done!

Alternative: Download on Windows → Transfer via SCP → Run on database server

No separate hosting server needed since ports are restricted.
No wget commands needed since browser download is simpler.
One command execution - completely automated.
