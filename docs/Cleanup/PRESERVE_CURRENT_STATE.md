# PRESERVE CURRENT STATE - DO NOT SYNC FROM REPO

## CRITICAL: This application is currently working perfectly

- Proper theme system in in
- Working App.tsx with full functionality
- Proper theme system in index.css
- All components implemented and working
- Authentication system functional
- No white screen issues

## The Problem
