# Debug Authentication Flow

## Current Issues
1. Login button shows feedback (text changes) but reverts quickly
2. User stays on login page even after apparent successful login
3. Navigation buttons may not be responding after login

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Login Process Logging
- Added detailed console logging with emojis for easy identification
- Multiple verification attempts to check KV store propagation
- Better tracking of state changes

### 2. KV Store Testing
- Added direct KV test button to verify storage works
- Added auth state check button
- Test setting user directly in KV store

### 3. App Component Debugging
- Enhanced render decision logging
- Better tab change tracking
- Improved button click logging

### 4. Button Interaction Debugging
- Better loading state tracking
- Enhanced click event logging
- Multiple test buttons with different approaches

## Test Sequence
1. Try the "KV Direct Test" button first to verify KV store works
2. Try "Check Auth State" to see current state
3. Try normal login with admin/12345
4. Try "Debug: Auto Login" button
5. Try "Direct Login Test" button

## Expected Console Output Pattern
```
🚀 AUTH: Starting login process for: admin
✅ AUTH: Service returned user: Local Administrator isAdmin: true
📝 AUTH: Setting user in KV store using functional update...
💾 AUTH: KV setter function called, setting user: Local Administrator
✅ AUTH: User set successfully
🔍 AUTH: Verification attempt 1:
  - Stored user: Local Administrator
  - Is admin: true
  - Character ID: 999999999
  - Auth result: true
🔄 === AUTH HOOK STATE CHANGE ===
🆔 Raw user value: [AuthUser object]
📊 User details: { hasUser: true, characterName: 'Local Administrator', isAdmin: true, ... }
🔐 Auth state: { isAuthenticated: true }
🎯 App render decision: { shouldShowApp: true, shouldShowLogin: false, ... }
🏠 Showing main app for user: Local Administrator with admin permissions: true
```

If this pattern doesn't appear, we have an authentication flow issue.
If it appears but the UI doesn't change, we have a rendering issue.
